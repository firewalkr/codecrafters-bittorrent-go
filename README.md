This is a very basic bittorrent client developed for a codecrafers.io challenge.

The download sections of the code in particular are very rough and this is in no way
production ready. The BitTorrent tracker and peers used by codecrafters while testing
this code were essentially working perfectly, i.e. all peers had complete file, and
network conditions were flawless.

This is a starting point for Go solutions to the
["Build Your Own BitTorrent" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/bittorrent/overview).

In this challenge, you’ll build a BitTorrent client that's capable of parsing a
.torrent file and downloading a file from a peer. Along the way, we’ll learn
about how torrent files are structured, HTTP trackers, BitTorrent’s Peer
Protocol, pipelining and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
